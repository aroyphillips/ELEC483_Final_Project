# ELEC483_Final_Project

Download the .zip file in this directory and add it to your MATLAB path. Then, simply run final_project.m, which calls demo_pgplvm with the simulated data from python. Additionally, there is the option to simulate data with the same parameters in MATLAB via mkSimData3_2DBump_phillips.m, or just changing the flag within final_project to run that.
